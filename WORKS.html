      → ASSIGNMENT I: Confounding Tools
      <br>
      <br>
       In this project, we are confined to the tools that are not typically used and programmed for designers. Having that limitation within our chosen medium has not only encouraged me to push my creativity, but has encouraged me to consider what approach I can take with the given brief. The brief asks of us to demonstrate our lives during quarantine. I decided to go for the idea of selfcare and how it has not only changed for me, but for the society. With the rise in cases and the need for products like disinfectants, face masks, and sanitizers, I decided to include those elements within my project to highlight the new norm of society. Additionally, with the idea of selfcare and its change, I demonstrated how face masks has changed from being a product of a night time routine, to a product that protects us from the variants.
       <br>
       <br>
       In my process, I was set on using a scanner and its effect on creating depth to foreshadow the repitition, or routine of selfcare and how it can be daunting at times during quarantine. My next step was to experiment and see how I can push that idea which brought on the plastic wrap. Using the plastic wrap to protect the screen and allowing me to work on the surface of the scanner, I began to smear the product onto the surface. From there, I poured sanitizer all over the screen and created a sheet mask out of clorox wipes. In my final piece, it demonstrates the new norm of society by showing the steps of disinfecting to ease our anxiety, just like how we apply a skincare routine into our lifestyle for relaxation.

      In this project, we are introduced to the functions of Javascript and are asked to dedicate everyday to coding a sketch of our given letter. I was assigned the letter "W".
      <br>
      <br>
      In the initial stages of my sketch, I took on a more geometric, abstract form in my sketches as I was very new to the functions of the Javascript software and many of my sketches had a focus on perspective. However, it wasn't until I learned how to use the mouse script that I began to plan out my design direction. Through my observation of the repitition in the circle forms of the mouse script, I wanted my designs to resemble the anatomy of a fish such as the scales and its body. Using a colour palette that was similar to that of a salmon and swtching to linear forms to mimic the scales, my letter "W" went from geometric to more complex linear forms.

     <br>
      In this project, we are asked to document and observe our interactions with our chosen device where we then use that data to create an interactive infograph of our interaction. Here, I chose to document my interaction with my device's Apple Pay feature.
      <br>
      <br>
      For the infograph, I envisioned it to be an interactive web-based format where it took on the design of a manual given that the process of using the application is a step-by-step process for the payment. There is a "phone" to the left of the infograph where the user interacts with, and to the right is where the qualitative data would appear throughout the interaction. The video below is a mockup on how the interaction would play out through a web-based format.
